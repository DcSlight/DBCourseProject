1. Command Pattern: 
   According to section 3.1 we used Command Pattern to support 
   express and standard shipping for any company.
   
   #Note:
   On DHLExpressCommand there is a method setNewProduct() that does nothing.
   The reason for it is that we wanted "DHL express" to be able to support any future 
   calculations with product data.
